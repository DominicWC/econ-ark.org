# The Econ-ARK Website

This site uses Markdown along with Jekyll site generator to compile a static site.

The site code is hosted here on GitHub, the compiled site is hosted on Netlify, and DNS configured with AWS Route53.

Any edits to the markdown files will be recompiled and pushed live upon commit to `master` branch. Changes should be visible <10 minutes.

So, to trigger a recompile (for example, in case some external source material has changed), edit this README.md
