Theoretical Foundations of Buffer Stock Saving

For a consumption/saving problem with transitory and permanent shocks and unbounded (CRRA) utility, this paper derives conditions under which a nondegenerate solution exists, and under which a target wealth ratio exists; all results are paired with illustrative numerical solutions.
