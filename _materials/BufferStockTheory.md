Theoretical Foundations of Buffer Stock Saving

For a consumption/saving problem with transitory and permanent shocks and unbounded (CRRA) utility, this paper derives conditions under which a nondegenerate solution exists, and under which a target wealth ratio exists; all results are paired with illustrative numerical solutions.

### Options for Executing This Notebook

1. [View (noninteractively)](https://github.com/llorracc/BufferStockTheory/blob/master/Code/Python/BufferStockTheory.ipynb) on GitHub (warning: sometimes GitHub does not render Jupyter notebooks)
1. [Launch Online Interactive Version](https://econ-ark.org/BufferStockTheory/launch) (warning: takes a couple of minutes)
1. Install [econ-ark](http://github.com/econ-ark) on your computer ([QUICK START GUIDE](https://github.com/econ-ark/HARK/blob/master/README.md)) then follow these instructions:
   1. At a command line, change the working directory to the one where you want to install
       * On MacOS/unix, if you install in the `/tmp` directory, the installation will disappear after a reboot:
       * `cd /tmp`
   1. `git clone https://github.com/econ-ark/REMARK --recursive`
   1. `cd REMARK/REMARKs/BufferStockTheory`
   1. `jupyter notebook BufferStockTheory.ipynb`
