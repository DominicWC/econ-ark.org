# SolvingMicroDSOPs Is an Exploration of Indirect Inference for a Life Cycle Model

The `do_all.py` file in SolvingMicroDSOPs is meant as a template for one kind of REMARK directory. It is a full-fledged module that can be imported and will create tools that can be used to specify the many options that govern exactly what is done by the tools in SolvingMicroDSOPs.

The `do_all.py` file is fairly self explanatory, the reader is urged to read it through before trying to run it. 

The content of what SolvingMicroDSOPs does is described in the last section of these lecture notes [SolvingMicroDSOPs](http://econ.jhu.edu/people/ccarroll/SolvingMicroDSOPs), on indirect inference.
